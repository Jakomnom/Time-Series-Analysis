# Time-Series-Analysis

### **NOTE: Statsmodels library has been updated since the time when the code was created. Can't be bothered to update atm, but the concept is still valid.**


In the field of time series analysis, a common and crucial area of focus revolves around assessing the stability of financial markets
and evaluating the efficiency of investment portfolios. By studying time series data related to financial instruments like stocks,
bonds, or commodities, analysts aim to uncover patterns and trends that can provide insights into market behavior.
This analysis helps investors and financial professionals make informed decisions about asset allocation, risk management, and the potential profitability of their investments.

This exercise takes a look at time series data from four market indexes: the SP500, the Dax30, FTSE 100, and NIKKEI 225.
I am very interested at exploring how to utilize Python in order to analyze and model such data. I also came to a 
realization that data science mainly relies on working with two types of data - cross-sectional and time series.
And learning about ARMA, seasonal, integrated, MAX and volatility models, is essential is to make accurate forecasts into the future.

When conducting time series analysis using supervised machine learning, we need to select the most appropriate
model. You usually start with a simple model and expand it, as long as it meets several conditions i.e significant coefficients.

We also want the model to keep it simple as it's generally accepted that simpler model > complex model.
Unless of course the complex model retuns better predictions.
